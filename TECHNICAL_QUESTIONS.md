# We recently migrated the majority of the backend from On-Premise to the cloud.
 1) Why migrating from On-Premise to Cloud ? Is it linked to Storage ?
 2) Which linux distribution did you use on your On Premise servers ?

# Spring Boot Architecture
 3) Which architecture are you using ? I guess Microservices . Do you also use monolithic ? Both ?

# IDE
 4) Which IDE are you using ? I use STS of eclipse because it has spring initializer built-in
